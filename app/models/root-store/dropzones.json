We have three annual boogies--Christmas, Spring and Fall--and operate fast-climbing turbine aircraft to 14,000 ft over the beautiful beaches of the Portuguese Algarve region.  Based on a municipal airfield the DZ facilities are ideal for month-long events for those jumpers looking for a family friendly sun, sea & skydiving location.  Jumps on to the local beach is a highlight for many skydivers who attend.  Always contact the DZ to check activity between annual boogies.",
